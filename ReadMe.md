#  NSE Stock Market Prediction 

_An implementation of the paper:_
    Hiransha M et al. , "NSE Stock Market Prediction Using Deep-Learning Models", ICCIDS 2018.

_This project will stay under development for the considerable future._
## Introduction 
* The paper uses 4 types of deep learning architectures to predict
  the stock price of a company based on historical prices.
    1. Multilayer Perceptron (**MLP**)
    2. Recurrent Neural Network **(RNN)**
    3. Long Short-Term Memory **(LSTM)**
    4. Convolutional Neural Network **(CNN)**


* Although the paper focuses on different stocks, this project will focus on the following stocks:
  1. Reliance Industries **(RELIANCE)**
  2. Tata steel (**TATASTEEL**)
  3. Godrej **(GODREJIND)**
  4. Bajaj finance **(BAJFINANCE)**
  5. Tata motors **(TATAMOTORS)**
  7. Larsen Toubro **(LT)**
